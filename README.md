# plainjs
A collection of projects using nothing but plain JavaScript, CSS and HTML. No frameworks no libraries. 

While working with the various libraries out frameworks out there, we can sometimes forget that new additions to native JS and the Browser API are being made all the time. These projects were intended to familiarize myself with these new awesome tools! Enjoy!
